<p> As a virtual research environment, openVRE aims to integrate tools and 
pipelines to enforce a research community. To this end, we are offering you the 
possibility to integrate your application in our platform, if you think it could 
fit in it. We encourage you to read though this documentation and contact us for 
any doubt or suggestion you may have. </p>
<h3> Benefits: </h3>
<ul>
    <li> openVRE is an open access platform, already active, published, and 
    supported by the community. openVRE offers computational and storage resources, 
    data handling utilities, user support and authentication services, on top of a 
    complete web interface. For each new tool, the web portal provides customizable 
    forms to set your applicationâ€™s parameters, and tailored viewers for your 
    specific output files.</li>
    <li> openVRE tools and visualizers may complement and add extra value to your 
    application, and interoperate with them is trivial once integrated.</li>
    <li> openVRE provides an admin panel for tool developers to control and manage 
    their tools.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Requirements: </h3>
<ul>
    <li> Your application or workflow should be able to run non-interactively in a 
    linux-based virtual machine (by default Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial Xerus).</li>
